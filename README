Version:	0.2
Author:		Shumon Huque <shuque@gmail.com>

tlsa_rdata: A program to generate DNS TLSA resource record rdata
from a file containing an X.509 certificate and given command
line parameters (usage, selector, matching-type).

Pre-requisites:

	Python 3.x
	M2Crypto module: a python interface to OpenSSL

Installation:

    * System wide (typically /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), as root:

        python setup.py install

    * In your home directory ($HOME/bin):

        python setup.py install --home=$HOME

    * Or just copy the "tlsa_rdata" file to wherever you want to put it.


Example runs:

    // Generate TLSA rdata from "server.crt" with parameters 3 0 1:

    $ tlsa_rdata server.crt 3 0 1
    3 0 1 7ef4bd014e9a4f302fc1ee74fb2d29718c5b0f4cb23b25b267a1d92f0410890b

    // If this certificate is to be used for the HTTPS server at
    // www.example.com, we just need to install the following DNS
    // record (into a signed DNS zone):

    _443._tcp.www.example.com. IN TLSA 3 0 1 7ef4bd014e9a4f302fc1ee74fb2d29718c5b0f4cb23b25b267a1d92f0410890b
